## My process

I used a mobile first design and broke the example picture into sections to figure out the structure needed.  I used a wrapper class and then 3 identical subsections.  My intention was to use CSS Grid, but I know I didnt use it correctly.

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

I learned the difference between selecting the body height at 100% vs 100vh.  At one point my footer ended up in the middle of the mobile design because of this.


### Continued development

I need to continue to work on CSS Grid.  I know with Grid i should have been able to make it automatically responsive so that i didnt have to add a media query, but i couldnt figure it out.  The grid-template-columns: repeat function I cant seem to grasp, especially when I dont know the exact sizing of each column to start.
