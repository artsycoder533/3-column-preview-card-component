## My process

I used a mobile first design and broke the example picture into sections to figure out the structure needed.  I used a wrapper class and then 3 identical subsections.  I used CSS Grid so I wouldnt need to use media queries.

### Built with

- HTML 5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow



### What I learned

How to use auto-fit with the repeat function in CSS Grid.


### Continued development

I need to continue to work on CSS Grid.
